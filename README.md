- **Automate repetitive tasks** (e.g., filling out forms).
- **Restyle pages** to improve readability or aesthetics.
- **Enhance user interfaces** for web applications.

These scripts are typically created by the community to enhance and personalize websites, making the internet work the way **you want** it to.
