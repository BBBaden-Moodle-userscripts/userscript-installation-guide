Tampermonkey and Greasemonkey are browser extensions that can execute additional scripts on web pages. This can be maliciously exploited, so only scripts from trusted sources should be installed! Be aware about the information that can be read by these scripts.


# What Are Userscripts?

Userscripts are small, custom scripts written in JavaScript that allow you to modify the behavior and appearance of websites you visit. They are powerful browser extensions that give you the ability to tailor your online experience to your preferences.

Userscripts can perform various tasks, such as:
- Adding new features and functionalities to websites.
- Automating repetitive tasks.
- Restyling web pages to improve readability or aesthetics.
- Enhancing the user interface of web applications.

Userscripts are typically designed and shared by the online community to address specific needs or to enhance popular websites and web applications. They offer a flexible way to personalize your browsing experience and make the web work better for you.

# Getting Started with Programming Userscripts

To start programming your own userscripts, you should first understand that userscript files should end with ``.user.js.`` This extension is important because it signals to Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey that this file is a userscript and should be treated as such.

For a comprehensive guide on how to program userscripts, you can refer to the official [Tampermonkey documentation](https://www.tampermonkey.net/documentation.php). This documentation covers everything from basic usage to advanced features, and it is a valuable resource for both beginners and advanced userscript developers.
