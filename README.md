## What Are Userscripts?

Userscripts are small, custom scripts written in JavaScript that allow you to modify the behavior and appearance of websites you visit. They are powerful browser extensions that give you the ability to tailor your online experience to your preferences.

Userscripts can perform various tasks, such as:
